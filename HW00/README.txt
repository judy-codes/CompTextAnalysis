How long did you spend on the assignment?
Maybe 5 hours or more. It is hard for me resist optimizing and shortening code right off the bat, so I go through a bunch of trials of code snippets 
even though I know how to implement the solution, so it takes me a long time. I also misintrepreted what a syllable, rhyme, and limerick is so that
added time as well. 

What did you learn by doing this assignment?
I learned what a syllable and what a limerick is. I realized that I know a lot less about the English language than I thought. I also learned that
you can add stresses to parts of the word that make pronouncations different. CMU's dictionary is very interesting. 

Briefly describe a Computational Text Analysis/Text as Data research question where it would be useful to be able to identify if a poem is a limerick or not (keep this answer to a maximum of 3 sentences).
When did the limerick date back to and what was the trend for it popularity throughout time? 

Feel free to add additional/optional feedback, e.g. what did you like or dislike about the assignment?
I don't think the textbook gave a good definition of what "phones" are. I got confused because I didn't realize that a 
syllable is only the phones in each of the pronouncations. I also had to Google what a syllable means in terms CMU's prounucation dictionary and 
dig deeper about how to define what a rhyme was. Although all the resources were there in the textbook and other places to get more clarity, 
it took me a bit of time to fully understand these definitions than I thought. There were also little things that would come up that would be 
annoying such as filtering out puncuations and blank spaces. I had to run the text.py a lot to discover these edge cases. These are just my random thoughts
I think the assignment overall was good and I am finally figuring out the nuances to the only fluent language I speak! :)
