Homework 01

How long did you spend on the assignment?
    Maybe 12 or 16. I spent a lot of time figuring out how the ML model worked
and misunderstood instructions or found layers of mistakes that made it take longer to complete the assignment.
For example, using lg instead of log. I hope that we can have more infrequent assignments, maybe alternating
readings and assignments across weeks or having an assignment every 1.5/2 weeks would be nice.

What did you learn by doing this assignment?
    I learned how algorithms are really similar and I understand how to create a machine learning 
model using different algorithms. It was surprisingly simplier than I thought. I sent a long time trying
to understand how they work together and I found it really efficent to look at test results and work backward.
I also was able to get better at using a debugger! 

Briefly describe a Computational Text Analysis/Text as Data research question where language modeling would be useful (keep this answer to a maximum of 3 sentences).
What can we learn from text using different algorithms? For example, what algorithm can be best leveraged to derive meaning from a 
specific corpus or is there a universal model that is widely accepted as the best to perform computational text analysis models?
