Findings from Running Wifi Dataset
    I thought topic 4 was interesting because it was full of words that I won't assume that were one coherent topic such as "could", "still", "population", "species", and "within". Topic 4 also had the most tokens for that topic. 
    Topic 0 was likewise with with words like "submarine", "refer", and "surname".The rest of the topic seem more coherent with topic 2 talking about natural processes, topic 1 talking about ocean life, and topic 3 talking about fonts and words. 
Summary of Quantifying the Effects of Text Duplication on Semantic Models
    In this research paper,it talks about the impact of text duplication on the performance of semantic models. They conducted an experiement on word embedding models such as Word2Vec and GloVE and saw if the performance of the models changed depending on 
    the amount of text duplication. They found that the increasing levels of duplication had a bad impact on the quality of word embedding and weren't as good at capturing the semantic meaning between words. The reason why this happened is because as you add more 
    duplicates the more diversity is lost within the text. The researchers suggests to remove the duplicated text use more advanced models that are less affected by text duplication so the impact is less.

Feedback 
How long did you spend on the assignment?
    Maybe 7-8 hours. I spent 98% of my time trying to match the results to the test cases and rereading the assignment code, reading, and other resources. It probably could have taken me 1 hour if 
    the test results made sense. 
What did you learn by doing this assignment?
    I learned how LDA works and I had to reiterate my understanding in order to implement it. 
Briefly describe a Computational Text Analysis/Text as Data research question where using LDA would be useful (keep this answer to a maximum of 3 sentences).
    A potential research question is taking different world history textbooks from United States history and see if there are trends and topics that differ among textbook. 
    The research question that can be discovered is if there is a bias towards a specific event or topic. World history textbooks tend to not be diverse and are very Euro Centric.
