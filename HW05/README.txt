3 Analysis (10 points):
How does the setup differ from the model you learned “by hand” in terms of initialization, number of parameters, activation?
    The setup differs from the model learned by hands in terms of initialization, number of parameters, activation because weights and biases (setting up betas etc) have to be set up by us,
    rather in this case, it does it by itself randomly. I also assume number of parameters would be different because you would be able to process more whereas you might be 
    constrained otherwise. In activation, we didn't need to code the sigmoid function. By using libraries, it allows us to prevent mistakes and also make sure it is used most optimially. 

Look at the top features again. Do they look consistent with your results for the last homework?
    They do not look consistent with the previous homework. Some of the answers given back are more specific, such as "breaker", "rules", and "stolen".
    Overall, I think the results are okay. They could be better and I think they are about the same accuracy level compared to the last homework. 

How long did you spend on the assignment?
    Maybe like 10-12 hours? I didn't really track this time. I did go through a bunch of small errors when doing lr_pytorch.
What did you learn by doing this assignment?
    I wish I could get a more holistic understanding of what is going on. I think I get confused with all of the matrices and get lost in them. I learned that I should
    not have used softmax (not sure why I did) and that there are a bunch of different loss functions and optimizers out there. 
Briefly describe a Computational Text Analysis/Text as Data research question where using LDA would be useful (keep this answer to a maximum of 3 sentences).
    A potential research question could be how do we implement classifers to excel. For example, if a company wanted to recategorize one of their fields and use them as new
    more board categories, how could we do that and how could we make it flexible to all types of data?
